IXA EHU-OpenNLP-Parser-EN module
==================

This module provides a simple wrapper that uses Apache OpenNLP
programatically to provide constituent syntactic analysis.

English parse model provided by Apache OpenNLP:

http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/en-parser-chunking.bin

Version 1.0 of ehu-opennlp-parse-en is being developed as part of the 7th Framework OpeNER European Project.

INSTALLING Version 1.0 of ehu-opennlp-parse-en module
=======================================================

Installing the ehu-opennlp-parse-en module requires the following steps:

If you already have installed in your machine JDK6 and MAVEN 3, please go to step 3
directly. Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. Install JDK 1.6
-------------------

If you do not install JDK 1.6 in a default location, you will probably need to configure the PATH in .bashrc or .bash_profile:

````shell
export JAVA_HOME=/yourpath/local/java6
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
````

If you use tcsh you will need to specify it in your .login as follows:

````shell
setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/java/java16
setenv PATH ${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
````

If you re-login into your shell and run the command

````shell
java -version
````

You should now see that your jdk is 1.6

2. Install MAVEN 3
------------------

Download MAVEN 3 from

````shell
wget http://ftp.udc.es/apache/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz
````

Now you need to configure the PATH. For Bash Shell:

````shell
export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ragerri/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
export PATH=${MAVEN_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
````

For tcsh shell:

````shell
setenv MAVEN3_HOME ~/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
setenv PATH ${MAVEN3}/bin:{PATH}
````

If you re-login into your shell and run the command

````shell
mvn -version
````

You should see reference to the MAVEN version you have just installed plus the JDK 7 that is using.

3. Get module from github
-------------------------

````shell
git clone git@github.com:opener-project/EHU-parse_EN_kernel.git
````

4. Move into core directory
---------------------------

````shell
cd EHU-parse_EN_kernel/core
````

5. Install module using maven
-----------------------------

````shell
mvn clean install
````

This step will create a directory called target/ which contains various directories and files.
Most importantly, there you will find the module executable:

ehu-opennlp-parse-en-1.0.jar

This executable contains every dependency the module needs, so it is completely portable as long
as you have a JVM 1.6 installed.

The program takes KAF documents (with <wf> elements as it needs tokenized text) as standard input and outputs constituent syntactic
analysis in treebank format, one sentence per line.

To run the program execute:

````shell
cat wfinput.kaf | java -jar $PATH/target/ehu-opennlp-parse-en-1.0.jar
````

GENERATING JAVADOC
==================

You can also generate the javadoc of the module by executing:

````shell
mvn javadoc:jar
````

Which will create a jar file core/target/ehu-opennlp-parse-en-1.0-javadoc.jar
